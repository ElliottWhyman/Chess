# Chess
This is my second, majorly refactored, working (mostly) chess game.

I haven't implemented win conditions, among many other complicated chess thingies. I know of some bugs and bugs are expected.

I also wish to clean up the GUIs

I do plan to add local multilayer through different clients and perhaps a computer AI - if your lucky ;), although that is a long way down the road
